Unfortunately today was extremely windy (which I guess will be Wyoming). I literally felt with the crosswinds like I was being swayed across the street which is kind of a scary feeling. It was probably the hardest I worked because with some of the headwinds on the downhill prevented me from gaining momentum and made the uphills twice as hard. That being said, the way back was a breeze. Literally. HA. I was extremely proud when Courtney said that we made this ride in a total of 4 hours! Yay! PS. I made it because Anthony biked in front of me on some of the hills and his ass provided inspiration.

I don't know if that's something that I should feel responsible for or not, but they were definitely not ""only as fast as their slowest rider."" Alex even had an asthma attack and they continued riding on. It was a huge motivation killer and we risked getting lost by being separated from the group when none of us were aware of the route we were taking. I've had this experience on other rides, so I think we need to work on communicating more effectively with weak riders to stay together.

Also - before we were separated, passing one of the other ride groups was incredibly difficult because their entire ride group was riding 2 abreast nearly 5 or 6 feet apart, taking up an entire lane of the road. I think we all need to work on passing more safely.

I don't want to sound like a downer though, so I'd also like to say that it was a beautiful route and I really appreciated the guidance of alumni and coaches. ",,,,,,57.39

I totally understand why I was put in group 6 (missed last week's saturday ride; I've been abroad so my skill level is a mystery), but I had hoped I might be able to get bumped up at least to group 4 or 5. I am already very comfortable on a bike, I prefer to ride at a speed of around 13 mph or more, I feel good about shifting/hiils/etc. There were a few people in the group who were around my pace but the rest of the group was very new to cycling and it was a challenge to force myself to be a lot slower than I normally would. That being said, it was a good exercise in patience and teamwork, and it reminded me of how important it is for everyone on our team to be there for each other all the time. 

***WE NEED SERIOUS LESSONS IN SHIFTING. the coaches were really nice and tried to explain shifting but I'm fairly positive about 95% of the people who were in group 6 have NO idea what they're doing.

I was trying to help others learn the ways of gear shifting, but I think we should have a skills day where we teach people how. I noticed people trying to go uphill with the highest resistance and that seems to be a huge problem.",,,,,,35.2

Like 5mph slow... Starting at the back of the line I came to a complete stop a few times when people decided to slow down in the middle of the road for no reason. Once a few of the more comfortable riders pulled, though, the pace picked up significantly. Great hill training!",,,,,,29.2

It took our coach HALF AN HOUR to come back to find us. The rest of the group went so far ahead that the SAG vehicle escorted us to our group. It was not a very safe situation, and I was very upset with the lack of supervision, especially since most of us are new riders and we were one of the slower/least skilled groups. Additionally, he wasn't the kindest coach when it came to his verbal encouragement. When we were doing the rotating pace line (when riders were pulling off to the left and letting the line pass before they joined the back of the line), if there was ever a space of more than four feet between two riders he would yell something along the lines of ""What are you doing?! Is that Caspar the Friendly Ghost?? Keep up!!"" Because it was our first intense ride, especially among hills and climbs, it was rather intimidating to be yelled at like that. Granted, he was very nice at the end of the rider and gave us his email so that we could ask him any future questions we may have. Some things during the ride just could have been handled better.

A lot of people did not like his constructive criticism, but I didn't feel like I got yelled at or spoken down to. He taught us quite a few things and I truly enjoyed this ride. The only concern I had was Group 5 did not ride as many miles as we wanted because Mike turned us around pretty early... ",,,,,,22.39
