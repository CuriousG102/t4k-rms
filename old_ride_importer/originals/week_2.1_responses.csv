We were supposed to ride Shoal with Sujata and Anne but we quickly realized it would have been dangerous for Anne to be out on the road. Ulrika and I would trade off teaching Anne skills and riding a loop with Sujata (we were at a parking lot in front of some fields on the Great Northern Rd on the route). In all, I did just 3 loops and helped Anne with Skills. ",0

Generally, things were communicated well. There was a range of skills and fitness levels, so there were frequently large gaps riders. 

I was concerned about stop signs. People generally stopped, but it seemed that the attitude was that the ride leader would stop at first and give the all clear, and then everyone was supposed to follow in a big group. So each person was not stopping individually at the stop sign. Maybe this is how it is supposed to be done.",27.08

It was a wonderful ride -- perfect weather for riding! Riding in a group of 7 was definitely challenging -- it was difficult to make sure that everyone stayed together -- but it was a lot of fun. We also had quite a few skill levels represented on the ride, ranging from experienced cyclists to someone's FIRST RIDE (yay Sunshine!), which proved to be challenging but rewarding.
