There were some difficulties with other riders- chain falling off chainring, strong headwind caused a slow pace, and difficulty climbing hills.  I still enjoyed it, it was just a challenge for everyone.  This is a great thing since everyone grows from challenges.  ",20 miles,1 hr. 30 min. ,12.6 mph,"Ross, Jasmine, Ashley ",Went Shoal Creek.

We crossed Mopac via the Far West bridge and rode in Northwest Hills -- through my neighborhood, actually -- all afternoon. We climbed the steepest hill we've encountered thus far, but all four of us made it -- very proud of our little group! It was also really fun to ride with a group of relatively experienced group of cyclists -- all of us were extremely comfortable on the bikes, which allowed for us to ride more quickly and for a long distance. IT WAS GREAT.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,30
