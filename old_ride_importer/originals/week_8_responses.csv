It was pretty easy even though we kept a decently fast pace. I was sweep which was new to me.

We got 1 taco at taco joint and then Miles and I went out east and did another 25ish. It killed me and I realized that I really need to drink more water and take food with me. But it was a really great ride and I was able to do 50 miles in < 5 hours which was really exciting. Miles was really fast and he pushed me which was great.",,,,,,92.25

Felt good, During the first ride we were originally with Stefanie, Kiara, Amy, and Anna but we split because the group was too large. Stefanie's group was also not being very conscious about safety on the roads, might be a good idea to have another safety skills clinic- when I was riding to the IM fields with Kiara and Anna both of them were very unsteady and weren't aware of things because they either hadn't gone or had forgotten the information.
