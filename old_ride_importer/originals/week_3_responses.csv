The first 5-8 miles were terrible with the hills but then it was relatively flat after that and we were flying. The road was more heavily trafficked than we expected and there were stretches without a good shoulder but it was a great experience. The turn by turns we used were:
1. Riverside to Pleasant Valley
2. R on Manor
3. R on Pershing Dr. 
4. Slight L to stay on Franklin Ave
5. L on MLK (stay on this forever, cross 183, eventually turns into Webberville Rd) 
6. Follow Webberville until the end then turn around and do it again 
7. (if onto Bastop) turn left towards 304S

I felt like I was Simba being lifted off of Pride Rock by Rafiki-if that makes any sense. 
We rode the Shoal Creek Route. I fell probably about 6 times, because I'm really bad at clipping out in time and putting my foot on the ground to stabilize myself when I stop. I'm not scared of falling itself,  but I'm a little bit worried about falling during times of heavy traffic. Me no want to get run over by car :( But hey, practice makes perfect right?! *nudge nudge* 
GOOD LUCK WITH FINALS. :)
