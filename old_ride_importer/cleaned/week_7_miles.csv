Kevin Helgren,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,32,02:28:54,12.8,"Leah Sprague, Sunshine Garrison, Doha Hussien and Vanessa Beltran","Wonderful ride! Unfortunately, Nguyen and Vaibhav had to bail early due to a knee injury (happened prior to the ride) and an upset stomach, but we ensured that they made it home safely. The rest of us really enjoyed the ride! It was the first time many of them had done Out East -- they seemed to appreciate the challenging nature of this route as opposed to the relatively easy nature of Shoal Creek.",,,,,

Maritza Ruiz Rodriguez,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,23.07,02:00:00,12,"Andy, Neha, Ben, Brandon, Emmy","Rode to Shoal Creek. This was the first ride that I did with teammates. I did some over break, but those did not count since they were with family members. It was a good experience and I learned a lot about when to shift gears, signaling, etc. I was a little sore that afternoon, but I was good the next day. Overall, it was a good ride.",,,,,
Nicole Goodin,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,23.7,02:00:00,10,Amanda V,Shoal Creek
Raveena Bhalara,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,36,02:45:00,13.3,"Val (2013 alum) Gil (2013 alum) Shelly, and Kristina Schommer","We did the McKinney route since the alums knew it well. This was the first long distance ride I'd gone on two months ago and it was great to see the improvement from that time! I was really happy about my progress, I'm hoping to do the longer version of McKinney to build endurance. Yay progress!!!",40,02:55:00,13.6,"Ashley Wallace, Sunshine, and Kristina Schommer",We did the Buda Taco route but instead of stopping at the taco shop we kept going for a couple miles that way we could reach a total of 40 miles. I've done this route a couple of times and I think this is the best pace we've kept with the least amount of stops. Go team!!!
Rita Nehme,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,23.07,02:00:00,12,"Benji, Emmy, Brandon, Maritza, Andy",We rode shoal creek. It was my first actual full ride over 20 miles since I was in Lebanon. I learned a lot about gear changing. It felt awesome!!,,,,,
Sunshine Garrison,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,30.59,02:55:11,10.4,"Kevin, Vanessa, Leah, Doha, (Nguyen and Vaibhav for a bit)","We started out from CPE and not too far down the road, Vaibhav had to turn around because he was not feeling well. Kevin road as leader and I rode as sweep. I was thankful for Anthony last week to witness him doing sweep. He was a good example to take from. I stayed back with Doha mostly and helped her learn how to properly shift gears. 
Once we got out of the city, Nguyen's left leg started to hurt. She said it happens every time she bikes. She couldn't keep going so I turned around with her to go back. We made it about 7 miles back and she just couldn't bike at all anymore. We waited at a bus stop for Vaibhav to come get her. Then I turned around to join back with the group. They were on their way back to CPE at this point. I returned to my sweep position and helped Doha mostly get over hills and catch up. 
The ride Out East last week was more challenging last week. This time it was a breeze since I wasn't sick and fighting flat tires. I really enjoyed being a sweep and being able to help. But I was really grateful for the time to catch up with the group after dropping off Nguyen since I could go as fast as I wanted. I like speed :D",40,02:55:29,13.6,"Ashley, Kristina, and Raveena","We left CPE to go out to Buda. Raveena led the beginning since the rest had not been on this route before. Once we got farther out, I rode first to keep us at a quick pace since we wanted to make 40 miles and needed to be back before sunset. It was a really nice, easy ride. There was one hill that challenged me but I was alright. This ride really let me work on gaining momentum quickly since we had a lot of street lights to pass through. We were going pretty fast of the way back; the average might have been around 18/19mph on our return."
Tanner Walker,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,40,03:10:00,14.2,"Josh, Trent",We were out in Giddings TX (Josh's family has a ranch out there) and we took advantage of the empty roads and beautiful weather.,,,,,
Teddie Owen,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,25.1,02:13:00,11.2,"Kitty Ho, Trudie Bruno",This was the first official ride I've been on since December. It was a lot easier than I thought it would be.
