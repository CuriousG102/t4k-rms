It was about 13 miles from the beginning to the end of the trail and back. I'm personally concerned about balance at  standstill, which is what caused my 1 fall and almost a second, but I am thinking/hoping it will get better with practice. I'm also concerned about sharp turns and biking in a narrow space, which I also hope will improve with practice."
