We crossed Mopac via the Far West bridge and rode in Northwest Hills -- through my neighborhood, actually -- all afternoon. We climbed the steepest hill we've encountered thus far, but all four of us made it -- very proud of our little group! It was also really fun to ride with a group of relatively experienced group of cyclists -- all of us were extremely comfortable on the bikes, which allowed for us to ride more quickly and for a long distance.

For my first ride I have to say I was a afraid of taking on 30 miles, but I had a great time and went with great people. I fell once which was a good improvement from my first trial on my bike. It was windy, and cold. I realized it was tougher coming back because we went against the wind. My poor bike got dirty since there was mud and water on the trail. My arms hurt, I'm sore.
