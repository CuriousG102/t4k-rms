We rode on Westheimer (worst idea ever, Ozarks route should not go on this street) I ride on this street and had never realized how awful it was for cyclists. So we biked around my neighborhood and then I awkwardly got us lost.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,21.5,1:42:00,12.6,Ellen Witte,Ellen and I rode with the Northwest Cycling Club. It was super awesome and was great since a woman knew the route since she had done it every week for almost 2 years and everyone in our ride group was really accepting and understanding that she and I were new riders.

Was 75% road-based/no trails. Good ride, I feel more comfortable biking on road now. Had one issue regarding left turn lanes- we accidentally got in the far left one/ was kind of difficult getting back over. Otherwise no problems.

My odometer is still not cooperating so used Akos' stats",,,,,Miles Hutson,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,24.31,1:37:00,15,Eric Arbour,,,,,,,,,,,Mukthi,Yes,33,2:40:00,12.5,"Dani, Hali, Nguyen","It was a good ride. A lot was learned

Good scenery. Was challenging but all in all a great ride.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Raveena Bhalara,Yes,20,1:48:00,10.6,Becca Hoffman,"We rode in Houston, which is never the best idea... Unfortunately we were stranded in a part of Houston where we literally couldn't cross the road and had to call Becca's dad to pick us up. After that we stayed on the safe side and rode only around the River Oaks neighborhood. Literally in circles.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Ross McGarity,Yes,24,1:52:00,12.7,"Kevin helgren, Jordan kohler",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
