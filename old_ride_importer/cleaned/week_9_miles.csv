Felt good we did 4 loops around. It was more of a recovery ride,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,35.5,2:37:00,13.5,Group 3 with the group ride,Fayetteville ride. Group 3. WE NEED TO LEARN HOW TO SAFELY PASS PEOPLE!!!!,,,,,Alex Patlan,Yes,28,2:00:00,14,"Julius, Dani","I can't remember the time because I cleared it before Saturday, but it was under 2 hours because Julius made us go crazy fast so he could get home in time. Then we went to Jack and Adams for our 100 mile check up. I was with Dani and Julius (2013).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,36.3,2:38:00,13.7,Group 3!,Good ride.

Kiara fell behind, so Kirby and I waited for her. It took our coach HALF AN HOUR to come back to find us. The rest of the group went so far ahead that the SAG vehicle escorted us to our group. It was not a very safe situation, and I was very upset with the lack of supervision, especially since most of us are new riders and we were one of the slower/least skilled groups. Additionally, he wasn't the kindest coach when it came to his verbal encouragement. When we were doing the rotating pace line (when riders were pulling off to the left and letting the line pass before they joined the back of the line), if there was ever a space of more than four feet between two riders he would yell something along the lines of ""What are you doing?! Is that Caspar the Friendly Ghost?? Keep up!!"" Because it was our first intense ride, especially among hills and climbs, it was rather intimidating to be yelled at like that. Granted, he was very nice at the end of the rider and gave us his email so that we could ask him any future questions we may have. Some things during the ride just could have been handled better.",,,,,Amy Wong,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,29.2,2:37:00,12.3,"Hali, Laura, Anna",,,,,,Andy Escobar,Yes,26,2:30:00,11.8,"Parth, Haley Gold, and Nguyen!",We went out East! It was a tough ride due to the super strong head winds that were going against us but we did a great job!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,29.2,2:30:00,12.3,Group 6!,This was a very difficult ride for me and I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that I still don't have my clips/pedals and since my shifter wasn't working so I was in the little gear the entire time.,,,,,Anna Scanlon,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,29.2,3:00:00,12.3,"Group 6 (Hali Rode, Laura Artiles, Andy Escobar)","Fayetteville was pretty frustrating. I totally understand why I was put in group 6 (missed last week's saturday ride; I've been abroad so my skill level is a mystery), but I had hoped I might be able to get bumped up at least to group 4 or 5. I am already very comfortable on a bike, I prefer to ride at a speed of around 13 mph or more, I feel good about shifting/hiils/etc. There were a few people in the group who were around my pace but the rest of the group was very new to cycling and it was a challenge to force myself to be a lot slower than I normally would. That being said, it was a good exercise in patience and teamwork, and it reminded me of how important it is for everyone on our team to be there for each other all the time. ***WE NEED SERIOUS LESSONS IN SHIFTING. the coaches were really nice and tried to explain shifting but I'm fairly positive about 95% of the people who were in group 6 have NO idea what they're doing. And I'm no shifting/gear-using pro, but I'm talking about simple, basic stuff like using less resistance when you're going up a hill...maybe we should do a short lesson in a meeting? just wanted to mention it",,,,,Anne Le,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,28.2,3:00:00,8,Group 6,,,,,,Anthony McCoy,Yes,40,4:00:00,12.6,"Courtney, Madi, Alex, Raveena","McKinney Falls Route.

A lot of people would not gain enough momentum on the downhills then would not properly shift for the uphills. Nguyen stopped in the middle of the railroad tracks when we were crossing them at the end of the ride then caused a massive pile up of riders that crashed from trying to go around her.

I felt challenged but it was great!,,,,,Courtney Schutze,Yes,40.08,4:00:00,10,"Raveena, Madi, Alex W., and Anthony",We did the McKinney route. It was a pretty tough ride on the way there. We were having head winds that were probably around 30 mph and it made it difficult to get up the hills. We had to stop a decent amount to catch our breath and drink water (I still can't drink and ride) but I am really proud of everyone for finishing it and making up for lost time on our way back. We booked it on the way back making up for lost time with the wind and stops. It was a great group to ride with.,25.43,1:54:19,12.9,Tina,I was really proud of Tina on this ride. She really kept up and pushed herself. We did Shoal Creek and we wanted to hit 30 but I was having pain from my shorts and so we decided to head back a little early.

We stayed together pretty well, and when people fell behind they would call fall back and we would get back together. It was a good ride and it helped me start to understand cadence and the proper way to shift. There was a point when three groups become a cluster and there was a bunch of unsafe riding that about gave me a heart attack. Momma bear came out and I got really afraid for peoples safety.

Matt showed us a different route to get to the Loop. The time includes a few breaks. We also faced a heavy headwind coming back. Matt and Ben taught me how to ride in a pace line.

That being said, the way back was a breeze. Literally. HA. I was extremely proud when Courtney said that we made this ride in a total of 4 hours! Yay! PS.

I don't know if that's something that I should feel responsible for or not, but they were definitely not ""only as fast as their slowest rider."" Alex even had an asthma attack and they continued riding on. It was a huge motivation killer and we risked getting lost by being separated from the group when none of us were aware of the route we were taking. I've had this experience on other rides, so I think we need to work on communicating more effectively with weak riders to stay together.Also - before we were separated, passing one of the other ride groups was incredibly difficult because their entire ride group was riding 2 abreast nearly 5 or 6 feet apart, taking up an entire lane of the road.
