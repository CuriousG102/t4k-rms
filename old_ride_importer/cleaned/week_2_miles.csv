Carly had a bad fall at the end and we had to have someone drive us home. I hope this will still count, even though I don't have all the details.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Brandon Ortiz,Yes,,,,,,25,2:30:00,14,"Alex Patlan, Kevin Helgren, Dani Alvarado",Out East Route,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,45,3:30:00,15,Austin Shaver,Out East RouteRoss McGarity,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,21,2:15:00,11,"Sam Trejo, Jordan Kohler, Jasmine Mills, Doha Hussein, Maria Pedroza","We went on an extended shoal creek route. We started at the CPE and did the shoal creek loop and then crossed mopac at Far West. We then rode around in a neighborhood west of mopac which was hilly and gave us good practice at shifting gears. One thing we need to work on is calling out hazards louder, some people are good at calling them out, just not loud enough for the people behind to hear.",,,,,Alex Webb,Yes,,,,,,21.5,2:00:00,11,"Benji, Anthony, Regan, Raveena",We rode east 22,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Jocelyn Matyas,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,23,2:00:00,13,Anthony and Josh,I believe we did the east route...

Everyone rode in a straight line and we had good communication. There were a few falls from clipping in and out, which is a safety concern, but the riding in general was safe. Also, I discovered that flat pedals blow when going up hills...",,,,,Eric Arbour,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,30,2:00:00,15,Miles,"Ride along biking trail in Dallas. Felt better about shifting, leading and signaling and riding the draft",,,,,Sam Trejo,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,21,2:00:00,12,"Ross, Jasmine, Jordan, etc.",Shoal Creek across the highway to Far West,,,,,Anthony McCoy,Yes,,,,,,20.5,1:48:00,11.9,"Alex W, Raveena, Ben K, Regan H.","Rode ""Out East"".  I was the ride leader.  I studied the map for an hour beforehand, and thought I had it fully memorized.  I learned that seeing a route on googlemaps and actually cycling the route are different things.  In short, I led the group in the wrong direction, but it was all ok.  We stopped, looked at our phones, and got back to campus safely.",22,1:36:00,13,Josh W and Jocelyn,"Rode ""Out East"" again.  After Tuesday's slight mess up, I studied the map again and corrected the issue.  I was ride leader again and everything went beautifully.  A fun group.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Vanessa Beltran,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,20,1:47:00,11.21,Ulrika Doederlein (2013 Alumni - Sierra),"We rode the McKinney Falls State Park route from our apartment. It was hilly and there was a headwind but it was a great route. She is great at communicating safety on the road (debris, holes, etc.) and helped me work on skills (emergency breaking, getting comfortable with drinking on the bike, looking back, riding in close proximity) at an empty parking lot at McKinney falls since we didn't get to do that at Training Camp and I thought it was really helpful."Patrick Grayson,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,36,3:00:00,12,Madi,Rode at McKinney Falls.,,,,,Mukthi Dasaraju,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,26,2:10:00,12.5,Leah - 2014,"Pretty easy ride in the Woodlands neighborhood (North Houston)- not much traffic.

I think we got lost, but our route ended up being really scenic and safe. Anthony did an excellent job of leading us, I felt pretty good about this ride. The only thing I'm concerned about is that we left sort of late and we were in crunch time to get back home before dark, luckily we made it!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,36,3:30:00,13,"Rachael Madison, Schuyler Dale, Elizabeth Schmidt, Patrick Grayson","We did the McKinney Falls ride, led by Madi. I was actually pretty excited I about this ride. It was the most difficult ride I've done thus far, but everyone finished strong and encouraged each other. And I didn't fall!",,,,,Elizabeth Schmidt,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,20,1:30:00,13,Kevin Helgren,"Doubled the Shoal Creek ride from skills clinic. Easy ride, good communication. A truck almost hit us flying out of a construction site without looking, but the crisis was averted.",36.35,3:00:00,15,"Madi, Raveena, Schuyler, and Patrick Grayson",We rode past McKinney Falls - I honestly had no idea where we were but we saw some cows and some goats. The ride was longer than we expected but was a lot of fun and wasn't difficult. Communication could have been a little better. I was sweep so I missed a lot of what Madi was saying at the front because it wasn't being passed back. Some of the teammates also need to work on staying close to the rider in front of you because at times they were separated because the gap was too large.,,,,,Kevin Helgren,Yes,,,,,,25,2:00:00,12.7,"Alex Patlan, Dani Alvarado, and Bradon Ortiz","We took the Out East route -- beautiful ride! We passed a couple of dead skunks in the middle of the road, but the creek that we stumbled upon made the stench well worth it. I felt awesome afterwards!",,,,,,,,,,,20,1:30:00,15,Elizabeth Schmidt,"Elizabeth and I rode the Shoal Creek route -- nice, relaxing ride. This was actually the first time I had ever ridden Shoal Creek; definitely a lot more relaxed than Out East. I enjoyed the last stretch of the loop (Shoal Creek itself). I felt very comfortable during and after the ride.",,,,,,,,,,Josh Walther,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,20,1:30:00,12,Anthony and Jocelyn,"Did the 20 mile Out East route.

Sorry to not be more specific but we didn't really map it all out.

We communicated pretty well by the end. We were slowed at one time by derailleur problems on my bike, but I managed to compensate and complete the ride with Eric. We both felt we could have done many more.",,,,,Alex Patlan,Yes,,,,,,25,2:25:00,12,"Daniella Alvarado, Brandon Ortiz, Kevin Helgren",We rode Out East. It was really great. Think communication went well. Got a little scary towards the end of the route but it was doable in the group because of communication.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Jasmine Mills,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,21,2:30:00,10,"Maria, ross, jordan, doha, sam",Shoal creek,,,,,Daniella Alvarado,Yes,25,2:30:00,10,"Kevin H., Alex Patlan, and Brandon",Out east,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
