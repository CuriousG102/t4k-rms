Felt good, During the first ride we were originally with Stefanie, Kiara, Amy, and Anna but we split because the group was too large. Stefanie's group was also not being very conscious about safety on the roads, might be a good idea to have another safety skills clinic- when I was riding to the IM fields with Kiara and Anna both of them were very unsteady and weren't aware of things because they either hadn't gone or had forgotten the information.",,,,,,30,02:15:00,14,"Anthony, Tanner, Ellen, Jocelyn, Dani","Shoal Creek once again.

This was Alex's first ride back on the bike after a month or so and we bit of more than we could chew. The straight incline all the way there was a workout and we also had some headwinds.

Anne also fell and hurt her leg. We put a bandage on it and she finished the ride. Anne has a problem with when she starts to rides to the left into the opposite lane and that should be worked on with her. It could be very dangerous if a car were to ever be coming.

Madeleine Dao,Yes,26.68,02:11:00,11,Mark Jones,"This ride was a little difficult for me. Mark and I were set on getting to the Buda Taco Route from San Jac. Once we hit South First street and started going up hills I got really discouraged and tired. I hadn't done that many hills and had a lot of trouble first with my gear changing and just getting enough momentum. Coming back was tough because we had a 10-11 mph head wind, so that didn't help. I had to stop quite a few times and hated that Mark had to go through that with me.",,,,,,24,02:20:00,12,"Rita, Anne, Kitty, Joe Marshall, Tanner and Josh Walter","We started from Kitty's house at Speedway and 42nd street and headed to Shoal Creek.

It was pretty easy even though we kept a decently fast pace. I was sweep which was new to me.

We got 1 taco at taco joint and then Miles and I went out east and did another 25ish. It killed me and I realized that I really need to drink more water and take food with me. But it was a really great ride and I was able to do 50 miles in < 5 hours which was really exciting. Miles was really fast and he pushed me which was great.",,,,,

We were going to do a full 36 miles but Anthony had a prior time commitment so that didn't happen, but I might not have made it had we had tried. Either way, my first half century!!! WOOT!",53.5,04:07:00,12.6,Shannon Kintner (Rockies 2011) and Thomas Allison (non-T4K),"We did my SECOND half-century today. (Feelin' pretty proud) There was definitely a noticeable difference because I was still sore from the day before, but I made it! We did Dam Loop which was really really really tough but! I did it! We did make a rather lengthy stop for Girl Scout Cookies which became kind of an emergency but I think sans Girl Scout Cookies we could have made the ride in under 5 hours!

We were kind of split up between 2 groups. Me and Maddie were in the faster group, then when they finished we joined the slower group and did some extra miles on a slower pace with them, so we can log more miles.

We did a couple of miles over 30 (I am not sure how many exactly)
