Proposed Cleaning Flow:

1) start with an originals/x.csv file
2) copy it to somewhere y.csv
3) remove the timestamps and total miles columns
4) assert that the first row of headers is all spelled right
5) sort by "have you ridden", and take out the no's
6) sort by name, and make sure there's no duplicates (or otherwise merge them properly)
7) maybe capitalize names? we can do this later too
8) save it using excel, move it to the cleaned folder
9) run python clean_spreadsheet.py cleaned/y.csv cleaned/y_cleaned.csv
10) eventually save it as cleaned/week_x_miles.csv
