Texas 4000 Rider Management System
======

#### Background

Alright, here it goes again. This is the *second* iteration of the Texas 4000 Rider Management System. If you want to see the first failed attempt, check out the [amancio](https://github.com/ethanperez/amancio) repository.

#### Purpose

The purpose of this piece of software is to allow the Texas 4000 team to better manage its intellectual resources. Currently, information is extremely de-centralized in Google Docs, MS Word files, Dropbox accounts, and across the space-time continuum. This Python/Django project attempts to centralize all team information.

#### Is this in production? What's its working status?

1/22/14: No yet. It is just beginning its roots, and I expect it to be in limited use starting 1/27/14.

#### Alright, well what's up next?

Here is a list of features that are currently being worked on, based off of what I've seen and what has been requested. You can email me at [ethan@ethanperez.com](mailto:ethan@ethanperez.com).
